Challenge: SQL Table Creation and Insertion
1. Write an SQL query to create a table called student with the following columns:
   
name (String, maximum length of 100 characters) 🎟️
age (Integer)🎭
gender (String, maximum length of 10 characters)🌟


CREATE TABLE student (
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10)
);

2. Insert at least 3 records into the student table. Each record should have a unique name, age, and gender.

   INSERT INTO student (name, age, gender)
VALUES 
    ('Alice Johnson', 20, 'Female'),
    ('Brian Smith', 22, 'Male'),
    ('Chloe Lee', 19, 'Female');

This repository contains the code and solutions for the **Database Design and Programming with SQL** course assignments.

## Assignment Overview

The assignments involve creating SQL tables, inserting data, and performing updates on a database.

### Completed Tasks

- **Created a `student` table** with the columns `id`, `fullName`, and `age`.
- **Inserted records** into the `student` table.
- **Updated data** in the `student` table to modify the age of a student.

### Files in this repository

- `answers.sql`: Contains all the SQL queries for creating the database, inserting records, and updating data.

## How to Run

To execute the SQL queries, you will need a MySQL server running. Once you have a MySQL instance running, you can run the following command to apply the SQL script:

```bash
mysql -u root < answers.sql
